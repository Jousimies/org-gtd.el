;;; Commentary:
;;
;; GTD needs logic to handle items that are knowledge, this is it.
;;
;;; Code:

(require 'org-gtd-archive)

(defcustom org-gtd-knowledge-func
  #'org-gtd-knowledge--apply
  "Function called when item at point is knowledge to be stored.
Note that this function is used inside loops,for instance to process the inbox,
so if you have manual steps you need to take when storing a heading
as knowledge, take them before calling this function
\(for instance, during inbox processing, take the manual steps during the
clarify step, before you call `org-gtd-organize')."
  :group 'org-gtd-organize
  :type 'function
  :package-version '(org-gtd . "3.0.0"))

;;;###autoload
(defun org-gtd-knowledge--one-off ()
  (interactive)
  (org-gtd-organize--call org-gtd-knowledge-func))

;;;###autoload
(defun org-gtd-knowledge--inbox-loop ()
  (interactive)
  (org-gtd-organize-inbox-item org-gtd-knowledge-func))

(defun org-gtd-knowledge--apply ()
  "Once the user has filed this knowledge, we can execute this logic."
