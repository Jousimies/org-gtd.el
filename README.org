* Org GTD
This package tries to replicate as closely as possible the GTD workflow.
This package assumes familiarity with GTD.

This package provides a system that allows you to capture incoming things into an inbox, then process the inbox and categorize each item based on the GTD categories.  It leverages org-agenda to show today's items as well as the NEXT items.  It also has a simple project management system, which currently assumes all tasks in a project are sequential.

For a comprehensive instruction manual, see the documentation.
Either the info file or in the [[doc/]] directory of the repository.
Upgrade information is also available therein.

You're also welcome to join my [[https://discord.gg/2kAK6TfqJq][discord server]] for all conversations related to org-gtd in particular and GTD in general. Many of the ideas for org-gtd came out of my reading the GTD book, and then reading some sections multiple times, but I am in no way an expert. Defining the GTD domain, which is to say, getting to clear nomenclature with clear actions, is still a work in progress.
